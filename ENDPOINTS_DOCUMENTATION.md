## üîí Security Notes

1. **Admin Routes**: All admin routes require SUPER_ADMIN role authentication
2. **User Routes**: User-specific routes require valid user JWT token
3. **Public Routes**: Limited to essential operations like registration, login, and viewing active announcements
4. **Soft Delete**: Most delete operations use soft delete (archiving) instead of permanent deletion
5. **Validation**: All endpoints use Zod validation schemas for request validation
